<p>Alex Nikiporenko is a London-based composer and curator of <a href="http://eightforty.co.uk/" target="_blank">840</a>.</p>

<p>His music often begins with a procedural constraint that shapes the unfolding of a piece. This underlying process functions as a generative tool rather than dogma, producing music that can be lyrical, direct or playful. Through reduced materials and repetition, the music retains a clear sense of its architecture while opening into unexpectedly vivid or generous sound worlds.</p>

<p>Named BBC/Guardian Young Composer of the Year and Britten Pears Young Artist, Alex’s work has been performed throughout Europe by soloists and ensembles including Juliet Fraser, Zubin Kanga, Anton Lukoszevieze, Fidelio Trio and Aurora Orchestra, and broadcast on BBC Radio 3. Modus Triplex, written for the Tre Voci cello trio, was nominated for a 2016 BASCA British Composer Award.</p>

<p>In 2015 he founded <a href="http://eightforty.co.uk/" target="_blank">840</a>, an experimental music series that, across more than twenty programmes, has presented new works by composers including Laurence Crane, John Lely, Georgia Rodgers and Sergei Zagny. Alongside his concert music, Alex has created site-specific and interdisciplinary projects. He teaches piano and writes software for the financial sector.</p>
